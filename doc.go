// GoT (short for go templates) is a template engine that generates fast go templates that you compile into your go code.
//
// GoT is similar to some other template engines, like hero, or fasttemplate, in that it generates go code that can get
// compiled into your program, or a go plugin. This approach creates extremely fast templates, especially as
// compared to GO's standard template engine. It also gives you much more freedom than Go's template
// engine, since at any time you can just switch to go code to do what you want.
//
// GoT has a number of advantages over other current offerings:
//   - Mustache-like syntax similar to Go's built-in template engine
//   - Ability to define new tags from within the template syntax, so you can create your own template syntax if you want
//	 - You don't have to use a specific function definition to call the template, so its more flexible.
//
// You can do a lot with just a few tags, so you don't need to learn a lot to use GoT. Get started in minutes.
