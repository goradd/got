// GoT is a flexible template engine that generates Go code.
//
// This approach creates extremely fast templates. It also gives you much more freedom than Go's template
// engine, since at any time you can just switch to Go code to do what you want.
//
// GoT has:
//   - Mustache-like syntax similar to Go's built-in template engine
//   - The ability to define new tags, so you can create your own template syntax
//	 - Include files, so you can create a library of tags and templates
//
// The GoT syntax is easy to learn. Get started in minutes.
//
// For complete usage documentation, see https://github.com/goradd/got
