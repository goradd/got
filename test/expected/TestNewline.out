Start of file. No extra newline should go above this line.

Embedded go code should not start a newline here.
A newline ended last item, so do not start an additional newline.

But if I add a blank line, then use it.

If I embed another tag with no newline 5, keep going

But if I end a new tag with a newline 10
consider it
